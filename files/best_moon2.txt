The scene is set on the moon, with black space instead of sky and grey rocky ground. 
Far away in space, Earth is visible blue and green. 
In the background, slightly on the moon stands a space ship with a sign reading "UNITED STATES". 
In the foreground in front of it is an astronaught, facing the viewer. 
At the right side of the scene in the background is an alien.

The astronaught says, "That's one small step for man..." and takes a step forward, while the alien moves towards him, looking at him.
When the alien is almost next to him, he says, "...one...".
The alien stops next to the astronaught and looks at him, with its body facing the viewer.
The astronaught says, "...giant leap for...", turning his head towards the alien.
When he sees the alien, he screams, "He???"
The alien turns to face him and bows its head, making unintelligible noises.
The astronaught says, "I come in peace!", and takes a step towards the alien.
The alien extends its arm, following which the astronaught is set ablaze with flames, accompanied by the noise of an explosion.
As the flames dance around the astronaught, the alien turns around to the opposite side and moves off the stage to the right.
The flames continue to burn and from the space ship the words emerge, "Houston...", and then, "... we have a problem!".

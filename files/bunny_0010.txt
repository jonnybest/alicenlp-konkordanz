There is a bunny in the picture turning towards the camera.
A piece of Brokkoli is in front of him.
A frog sits left of the Brokkoli facing it.
Behind the frog there is a mailbox.
Behind the mailbox there is a palm.
Everything is placed on grass.
The bunny hops to the Brokkoli and eats it. 
Then it turns and moves to the rabbit and taps its foot.
The frog turns left and hops 3 times away.
The bunny then hops 3 times to the mailbox, opens it and looks down on the floor.
While looking down, the frog turns around, hops to the bunny and ribbits.

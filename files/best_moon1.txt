At the start the astronaught is facing to the front of the screen and the monster on wheels is positioned towards the back of the screen. A speech bubble then appears from the astronaught reading "That's one small step for man..." and the man takes a step foward. The monster then comes towards the astronaught and another speech bubble appears from his head saying "...one...". The astronaught's head then turns to face the head of the monster and the next speech bubble pops up reading "...giant leap for..." and then another saying "He???". The monsters body then turns to face the astronaught and the moster makes stranges noises and nods slowly. The astronaught then turns his body fully to face the monster and replies "I come in peace!" and raises his left leg to take a big leap forward towards the monster. The moster then extends a hand and sets fire to the astronaught. The fire lasts for around 10 seconds. Meanwhile, a speech bubble then appears from the shuttle reading "Houston..." "...We have a problem!" The animation is then complete.

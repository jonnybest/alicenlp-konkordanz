The stage is a grassy field, with blue sky as a backdrop.
The characters are a ninja tortoise, a rabbit and a T-Rex.
The tortoise is standing just to the left of the centre of the stage, facing the viewer.
The rabbit is sitting next to it to the right, looking at the tortoise.
The T-Rex is standing to the right of the stage, looking at the rabbit.
The scene starts by the T-Rex making a loud "ROAAAAAAAAR!!!", opening its mouth wide.
The rabbit is scared from this and runs away from the T-Rex, behind the tortoise.
It hops around the tortoise and stops left of it.
Both the rabbit and the tortoise turn to face the T-Rex and the tortoise walks towards it.
It says, "Hey, evil T-Rex, stop scaring my friend!", to which the T-Rex replies with another loud "ROAAAAAAAAR!!".
The tortoise says, "Well, I guess I have no choice but to kick your butt."
It jumps up, raising its right leg, and kicks the T-Rex's head from below.
The T-Rex's head is knocked back, followed by its whole body being sent flying. It turns over backwards and falls on its back.

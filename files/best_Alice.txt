The stage consists of a blue sky and a grassy green ground. In the background is a large tree whose trunk splits into two large branches which form the tree's crown. 
The crown is cut off at the top at the stage. 
The tree stands slightly to the left of the horizontal centre of the stage and drops a shade to its right.
In the foreground, to the left of the stage stands the girl Alice.
She is facing towards the viewer but turned 45° to the left of the stage.
On the right side of the stage in the foregrouns is a dark hole in the ground.
Behind the hole, further back to the stage sits a white rabbit, facing towards Alice.

The rabbit shouts "Hello!". 
Alice then turns to face the rabbit and says "???". 
The rabbit hops three times towards Alice and says "Come over here!". Alice shakes her head. The rabbit says, "Come on! What time is it?" Alice then says "Oh..." and hesitantly walks towards the rabbit. 
After two steps she says, "Okay...". She stops in front of the rabbit. 
Suddenly, a grinning, orange striped cat appears between the two branches of the tree and says ":-D". It turns its head towards Alice and the rabbit, who turn their heads towards the cat. 
The rabbit screams "Ahhhhhhhh!" and turns around towards the hole. 
As the rabbit starts hopping towards the hole, Alice shouts, "Hey! Wait!" and turns towards the hole too. 
The rabbit jumps into the hole.

The start depicts a boy facing to the right of the screen, and a woman facing to the front. The woman then raises her left arm and a speech bubble appears from her mouth which reads "hello." She then proceeds to wave, still facing forwards, and turns to face the man. Next she extends her right hand and shakes. A speech bubble then appears from the mouth of the man which also reads "hello," and he raises his left arm and waves. He then places his arm back by his side. Both characters then raise their left arm upwards in a smooth motion at a 90 degree angle and rotate multiple times. Both arms are then replaced at the characters hips before they raise their left arm 90 defrees once again and wave. The animation is then complete.

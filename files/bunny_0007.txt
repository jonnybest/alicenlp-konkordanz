On the upper half of the screen is a clear blue sky. 
On the lower half of the screen is a green meadow. 
On the right in the foreground sits a Bunny on his hind legs facing southwest. 
Before the Bunny stands a mushroom. 
On the left side in the foreground stands a palm with a brown trunk and green leaves. 
Before the palm and somewhat to the left of it stands a shut mailbox on a brown post. 
To the right of the mailbox a little more in the foreground sits a green frog with a yellow belly facing southeast in the direction of the mushroom. 
The Bunny turns his head and body slightly to the left facing exactly to the south. 
The Bunny jumps upward three times and then bends forward, lies down on the meadow and eats the mushroom. 
Then the Bunny stands up on his hind legs again and turns right facing west in the direction of the mailbox. 
The Bunny taps his left foot leg twice on the ground. 
Then the frog turns to the left facing northeast and making three jumps to the background. 
The Bunny hops to the mailbox, opens it and looks into it. 
The frog turns to the right now facing southwest and hops in two jumps to the right side of the Bunny.

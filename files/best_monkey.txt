The sky is blue and the stage is a field of grass.
At the start of the scene, on the left is a light bulb which is off.
Behind it to the right is a yellow duckling wearing red socks, a crown and a scepter.
Next to the bulb on the ground is a switch, with a brown monkey next to it, facing the button but slightly turned towards the viewer. 
The duckling is facing just slightly past the monkey. 
To the right is a penguin with white stomach and face and blue back and wings. 
It is facing the viewer. Behind it to the left is a metal bucket. 
Rightmost of the stage, in the back, is a sunflower, facing towards the characters.

First, the duckling turns completely towards the monkey and waves its scepter at it.
The monkey then turns towards the switch, hops towards it and bends down to press it, which causes the light bulb to turn on.
The penguin then jumps, flapping its wings. 
Simultaneously, the monkey nods.
After a short pause, the penguin turns around towards the back of the bucket behind it, jumps onto its stomach and slides towards the bucket, flapping its wings again.
It knocks the bucket over and then jumps back on its feet, still facing the back of the stage.
The duckling turns around towards the penguin and wiggles from one foot to the other three times, waving its scepter.
The penguin then turns towards the duckling, jumps onto its stomach again and slides through the duckling, knocking it over.
The penguin jumps back on its feet, directly after which the monkey's jaw drops and the monkey shakes its head.
The monkey then bends down to press the switch again and turns off the light.

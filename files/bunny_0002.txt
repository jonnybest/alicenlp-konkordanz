I see a palm tree on the left of the screen, a mailbox in front of it. 
In the foreground there sits a frog on the left and a hare on the right of the screen. 
The hare hops and bends forward to eat something. 
The frog looks at what the hare does. 
The hare turns to the frog and taps its hindpaw. 
The frog turns its back to the observer and hops to the back (into the background). 
The hare hops to the mailbox and opens it. 
He looks inside. 
The frog turns back to the hare and also hops to the mailbox.
